# Perceptron Neural Network

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a basic implementation of a Perceptron Neural Network in Python. It involves training the network using random weights and bias, followed by testing it with specific input.

## How It Works

The Perceptron is trained using a dataset, adjusting weights and bias to match the provided inputs. Once trained, it can predict outputs based on new input values.

## Testing

To test the trained Perceptron, modify the `entrada_teste` variable in the `ia-perceptron-de-resenblatt.py` script with new values and execute the script again.
